## Overview

This repository contains my assignments related to Java programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each assignment focuses on specific aspects of programming and software design.

## Assignments

### 1. Ball Collision Game

In this assignment, I implemented an interactive program to play a board game. The goals were to gain knowledge in basic JAVA programming, including variables, loops, string operations, and file read/write operations. Additionally, I adhered to coding standards throughout the development process.

### 2. Smart Home Accessories

The goal of this project was to implement a robust Object-Oriented Design (OOD) for a scenario involving smart home accessories. The accessories included Smart Lamp (with white ambiance and color-white-ambiance variants), Smart Plug, and Smart Camera. The focus was on controlling these devices and managing time flow through various commands.

### 3. Library Management System Project

For this project, I implemented a simple library management system. The system handles daily library operations, catering to students and academics as members. The main features include borrowing and returning books, managing deadlines, imposing fees for overdue books, allowing deadline extensions, and handling restrictions on certain books.

## Usage

Each assignment or project is organized in its respective directory. You can find detailed instructions and documentation within each directory to understand the code and project requirements.
